## Features

- Create and store rules in a SQLite database.
- Retrieve all stored rules.
- Evaluate individual rules against user-defined data.
- Evaluate combined rules using logical operators.
- Simple command-line interface for interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLite (included with Python)
